    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Memoization is a technique where we store the results of function calls in a cache, so if the same input comes again, we return the cached result instead of recalculating it. For example, if we have a function that fetches user details from a database, calling it multiple times for the same user will be slow. Using memoization, the first call fetches and stores the user data, and subsequent calls return the cached data, improving performance and saving resources</h1>
